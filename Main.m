%This is the code used to analyse the expression data and to fit it to the
%gene expression model

%Input of the code is a table (in this example 'meansCUP') that was
%extracted using YeaZ

%The structure of the table is as follow:
%A row contains expression values for a single cell through time
%row id is the id of a cell as defined in the YeaZ output
%column id is the timepoint (frame number) in the analyzed movie 
%(0 timepoint corresponds to colum index 1 since counting in Matlab starts from 1)

%For expression values before the birth of a cell,
%and in case the cell with a specific id doesn't exist
%the table contains NaN values
